Come join our Teen Costa Rica Surf Camp for the best surf experience of a lifetime! This adventure is for beginner to advanced surfers who want to learn how to surf or improve their skills while being immersed in the culture of Costa Rica. Surf two sessions daily at several of Costa Rica’s best breaks while exploring in “Pura Vida” style!

Costa Rica is one of the safest and easiest international travel destinations in the surfing world. It’s an extremely safe and sustainable country with no standing military. With a brand new renovated international airport in Liberia and well-maintained highways, Costa Rica is very welcoming to tourists. Due to its friendly culture and “rich coastal” natural resources, Costa Rica is rated one of the hottest eco-travel and best surfing destinations in the world!

To provide comfort to both campers and parents, we offer campers the option of flying out of the Atlanta-Hartsfield International Airport (ATL) with one of our trip leaders into the Liberia International Airport (LIR). Campers may also fly directly into (LIR) where they will be met by the rest of our team. Campers will have their choice of boards from our full quiver or you may bring up to two of your own.

With a 3:1 camper to instructor ratio, the personalized coaching each participant receives during this camp is unmatched. More advanced surfers will learn new maneuvers and break out of their comfort zones while less experienced surfers will progress to paddling into their own waves and learning about wave dynamics.
