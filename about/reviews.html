            The camp opened my eyes to a new way of living. From waking up at dawn to catch the glassiest waves, to
            putting on zinc not only to protect our faces but to establish ourselves as warriors of the waves, with tribal
            markings on our cheeks. We became determined and passionate towards protecting the ocean by doing beach clean
            ups and visiting sea turtle hospitals.

            I found people had come from all over the country: Florida, Massachusetts, Illinois, even Washington State.
            It was a great mixture of people, and already I had completely forgotten about all of the problems I had earlier
            that morning. <br> The camp is great for anyone, from those who have never touched a board before, to those who have been surfing
            all their lives. <br> That was the most awesome week of my life!

            “Rozy surf camp rocks! I never knew how surfing could change my life. I wish that I could explain in words
            what it means to me but I don’t think I will ever be able to. The staff at Rozy Surf Camp understands exactly
            how I feel. If you ever wanted to learn or are learning this is the place for you.
