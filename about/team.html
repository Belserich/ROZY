    <h1>Team</h1>

    <p>Together, our professionally trained employees offer over 150 years of surfing experience to provide the
        highest-level,
        professional surf training. We comb through hundreds of applications every year and hand select only the best to
        join
        our team. All employees must go through our comprehensive in-house certification program before they are granted the
        responsibility of student instruction. Our team consists of professionally trained educators with 1000+ teaching
        hours
        to all types for students of all levels.<br>-
    </p>

    <p>This is no ordinary staff. We only employ the highest quality individuals with overlapping and complementary
        qualifications. Together, our staff possesses deep knowledge and an impressive base of experience, including an
        Ocean
        Safety Director, an EMT, and a Wilderness First Responder. All Rozy Surf Camp instructors are American Red Cross
        Lifeguard, CPR, Water Safety, and First Aid Certified. Most importantly we also have a burning desire to better
        ourselves in every aspect of our programs. We utilize consultation and training from Ocean Safety experts outside
        our
        organization for continuing education. We value and incorporate feedback from students, staff, and parents as we
        continually evaluate and better our policies and instruction-methodologies.<br>-
    </p>

    <p>All our quality control policies and procedures take valuable resources to implement and carry out. At the end of
        every
        day, your utmost safety and quality experience mean everything to us. We want you to have an unforgettable adventure
        that will change your life forever!
    </p>
