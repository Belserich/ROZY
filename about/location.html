Come join our Teen Las Palmas Surf Camp for the best surf experience of a lifetime! This adventure is for beginner to advanced surfers who want to learn how to surf or improve their skills while being immersed in the culture of Las Palma. Surf two sessions daily at several of Las Palmas' best breaks while exploring in “Pura Vida” style!

Las Palmas is one of the safest and easiest international travel destinations in the surfing world. It’s an extremely safe and sustainable country with no standing military. With a brand new renovated international airport in Liberia and well-maintained highways, Las Palmas is very welcoming to tourists. Due to its friendly culture and “rich coastal” natural resources, Costa Rica is rated one of the hottest eco-travel and best surfing destinations in the world!

To provide comfort to both campers and parents, we offer campers the option of fly directly to Airport El Matorral(AEM) where they will be met by our team.

With a 3:1 camper to instructor ratio, the personalized coaching each participant receives during this camp is unmatched. More advanced surfers will learn new maneuvers and break out of their comfort zones while less experienced surfers will progress to paddling into their own waves and learning about wave dynamics.
