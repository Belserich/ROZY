Team

Together, our professionally trained employees offer over 150 years of surfing experience to provide the highest-level, professional surf training. We comb through hundreds of applications every year and hand select only the best to join our team. All employees must go through our comprehensive in-house certification program before they are granted the responsibility of student instruction. Our team consists of professionally trained educators with 1000+ teaching hours to all types for students of all levels.

This is no ordinary staff. We only employ the highest quality individuals with overlapping and complementary qualifications. Together, our staff possesses deep knowledge and an impressive base of experience, including an Ocean Safety Director, an EMT, and a Wilderness First Responder. All Rozy Surf Camp instructors are American Red Cross Lifeguard, CPR, Water Safety, and First Aid Certified. Most importantly we also have a burning desire to better ourselves in every aspect of our programs. We utilize consultation and training from Ocean Safety experts outside our organization for continuing education. We value and incorporate feedback from students, staff, and parents as we continually evaluate and better our policies and instruction-methodologies.

All our quality control policies and procedures take valuable resources to implement and carry out. At the end of every day, your utmost safety and quality experience mean everything to us. We want you to have an unforgettable adventure that will change your life forever!
