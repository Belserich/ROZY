        <h2 class="centered">Five Reasons to Send Your Child to Rozy Surf Camp</h2>
        <ul id="reasonlist">
            <li><strong>It’s a huge Confidence builder!</strong>
                <p>Whether your child is a beginner or an advanced surfer our camps are extremely beneficial for
                    building kid’s and teenagers confidence. Our low instructor to student ratio (1-2 or 1-3) helps
                    ensure all students get the most hands on guidance as possible and that instructors can help
                    students of all levels meet their goals on the waves.</p></li>
            <li><strong>Time to disconnect.</strong>
                <p>In today’s day in age, we believe it is important for students to spend time away from the digital
                    world and focus on what’s happening right in front of them! At our Rozy Teen Overnight Surf Camps we
                    limit student’s access to their phones so students can be present, make new friends and focus on and
                    reach all their goals at camp, without social media to distract them.</p></li>
            <li><strong>It’s great exercise!</strong>
                <p>Camp is the perfect way to keep your kids healthy, both mentally and physically!</p></li>
            <li><strong>Gives you a break!</strong>
                <p>We all love our kids, but as we all know, distance makes the heart grow fonder. Seriously, all
                    parents need a break over the summer and our kids need a break from us as well! Rozy camps provide
                    the perfect get away for students and parents.</p></li>
            <li><strong>Building lifelong friendships!</strong>
                <p>At Rozy Surf Camp we pride ourselves on the accepting and fun loving community and culture we have at
                    our camps. Students get to meet others in the area (or others from out of state!) and form lifelong
                    friendships.</p></li>
